# STM32F429-DISCOVERY

Welcome to the STM32F429-DISCOVERY Projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of diverse projects and experiments developed for the STM32F429I-DISCOVERY board. This repository serves as a learning and exploration space for embedded systems development, featuring applications ranging from basic peripheral control to advanced graphical user interfaces and dsp.

## Projects Overview
### **1. DSP**
  Project implementation of digital signal procesing with graphic interface using ADC and DAC with DMA implementation of 6th order digital filters for audio with a sample frequency of 72KHz.

### **2. LCD**
  Implementation of a graphic interface and ADC with DMA. Input 


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. **STM32CubeIDE** or other supported IDEs like Keil.
2. [STM32CubeMX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html) for peripheral configuration.
3. Basic knowledge of embedded systems and the STM32F4 series.

### Setting Up the Environment
